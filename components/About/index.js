              <AboutSection.Body>
                MechMania is a 24 hr AI Hackathon where participants write a bot that 
                plays a game! The staff has spent the past year writing a game and are 
                challenging you to win it all. Anyone is free to participate at any 
                point during the 24 hours, no extra applications or registrations 
                necessary. Just show up! You can participate solo, or as a Section of up 
                to four! MechMania is open to all skill levels of coding, and in the 
                past couple of years, we have had multiple freshmen place in the top 
                few teams! We provide you with starter code in Java and Python. No 
                experience with ML, AI or Deep Learning is required to participate. 
                The point is for you to have fun, and to write something that you will 
                be proud of at the end of the 24 hrs. Throughout the event, staff will 
                always be available for you to ask questions about code or the game itself. 
                Everything is completely virtual, you can be in the comfort of your own 
                bed and participate too! What is the game? You'll just have to join us 
                on (date and time TBD) to find out, won't you? ðŸ˜‰ (btw, there 
                will be prizes awarded to the top 3 teams too!)
