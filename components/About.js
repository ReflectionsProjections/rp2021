              Reflections|Projections is an annual technology conference held at
              the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We bring industry
              and academia into one conference to incite the spread of novel
              ideas, connect students with professional opportunities, and host
              a one of a kind AI hackathon.

              Conference Format + COVID Guidelines
            </AboutSection.Title>
            <AboutSection.Body>
              In order to adhere to university safety guidelines, our conference
              will be held in a hybrid (in-person and virtual) format. As we
              approach the conference dates, we will publish the specific
              details of each event. Please remember that masks should be worn
              at all times to any in-person events, as we want to do our part in
              preventing the spread of the virus.

            <AboutSection.Body>
              We are excited about the opportunity to leverage this hybrid event
              format to make our talks and conference events more accessible to
              people throughout the global CS community, but also allow students
              who are on campus to be able to interact safely with one another.

            <AboutSection.Title>MechMania</AboutSection.Title>
            <AboutSection.Body>
              MechMania is a 24 hr AI Hackathon where participants write a bot
              that plays a game! The staff has spent the past year writing a
              game and are challenging you to win it all. Anyone is free to
              participate at any point during the 24 hours, no extra
              applications or registrations necessary. Just show up! You can
              participate solo, or as a group of up to four! MechMania is open
              to all skill levels of coding, and in the past couple of years, we
              have had multiple freshmen place in the top few teams! We provide
              you with starter code in Java and Python. No experience with ML,
              AI or Deep Learning is required to participate. The point is for
              you to have fun, and to write something that you will be proud of
              at the end of the 24 hrs. Throughout the event, staff will always
              be available for you to ask questions about code or the game
              itself. Everything is completely virtual, you can be in the
              comfort of your own bed and participate too! What is the game?
              You'll just have to join us on Friday September 24th at 12 PM to
              find out, won't you? ðŸ˜‰ (btw, there will be prizes awarded to the
              top 3 teams too!)
