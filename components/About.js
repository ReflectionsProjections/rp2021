              approach the conference dates, we will publish the specific
              details of each event. Please remember that masks should be worn
              at all times to any in-person events, as we want to do our part in

              format to make our talks and conference events more accessible to
              people throughout the global CS community, but also allow students

No experience with ML, AI or Deep Learning is required to participate. The point is for you to have fun, and to write something that you will be proud of at the end of the 24 hrs. Throughout the event, staff will always be available for you to ask questions about code or the game itself. Everything is completely virtual, you can be in the comfort of your own bed and participate too! What is the game? You'll just have to join us on Friday September 24th at 12 PM to find out, won't you? ðŸ˜‰ (btw, there will be prizes awarded to the top 3 teams too!)
