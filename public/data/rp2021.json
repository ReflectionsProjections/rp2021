A number of letters in the alphabet, number of cards in a deck, all the US state abbreviations, and silly other things that you've probably run across in your daily life. Some awareness of the recent memes and popular culture will probably be helpful. Knowledge of current events at UIUC and the campus layout will be really helpful."

It might be useful to be able to write a script to print out all the ways you can rearrange a set of letters, or apply different ciphers to them, but in general, you should be able to do everything by hand or ask Google and find a tool online to do it for you."

            "answer": "The R|P Symposium is the outreach arm of the event focused on bringing computing concepts in a simple manner to K-12 classrooms. The goal is to use college student presentations to inspire younger students, especially those with fewer opportunities to be exposed to CS, to consider computing as a field."

            "answer": "Following each lesson, we provide students with exercises and resources that we recommend students to try out if they want to learn more. If the lesson is part of a series of videos, we encourage you to work through them piece by piece, working on the recommended exercises and supplementary materials before moving on to the next one."
